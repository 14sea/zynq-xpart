# Pblock for the reconfigurable partition (the TPU), Phase 3 DFX.
# Defined by SITE RANGES (not the whole clock region) so the bounding box stays
# over the logic columns and excludes the central clock spine (which is illegal
# in a reconfigurable partition). Covers all logic of region X1Y0: 1100 SLICE +
# 20 DSP48 + BRAM — RM1's TPU (16 DSP, 1 BRAM, ~700 LUT) fits with room to spare.

# NOTE (M7.2, 2026-06-25): CONTAIN_ROUTING was tested here and REVERTED — it contains
# the RM routing but does NOT keep static (NEORV32) routing out of the RP region, so it
# does not isolate the RM bitstream from firmware-size-driven static routing. See
# docs/m7_2_dcpdiff.md §routing-isolation. Routing isolation is not achievable on this
# 7-series part with standard knobs (only logic sites are reserved, not the routing).

# Phase 4 (LUT-INIT surgery): disable bitstream CRC so a host-edited LUT INIT in
# the partial bitstream still loads (no CRC recompute needed).
